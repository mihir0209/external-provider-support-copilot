# Custom AI Backend Server for Copilot

This script sets up a Flask-based server that acts as a middleware between the Copilot environment and an external AI provider API (A4F). It facilitates communication, model management, and streaming responses for real-time AI interactions.

## Features

- Connects to the external A4F API for model listing and chat completions.
- Implements retry and cooldown mechanisms to handle rate limits.
- Supports streaming responses to enable real-time, incremental data delivery.
- Provides endpoints for version info, model tags, and model details.

## Connection Workflow

1. **External Provider Connection**:
   - The server communicates with the A4F API endpoints (`https://api.a4f.co/v1/models` and `https://api.a4f.co/v1/chat/completions`) using the `requests` library.
   - Authentication is handled via an API key stored securely in the `.env` file (`A4F_API_KEY`).

2. **From Ollama to External Provider**:
   - The server receives requests from the Ollama environment (or similar clients) via defined Flask routes.
   - For chat completions, it forwards the request payload to the A4F API, manages the response, and streams the data back to the client.

3. **Streaming Support**:
   - Streaming is enabled to provide real-time, incremental updates during chat interactions.
   - The server uses `requests`'s `stream=True` feature to receive data chunks from the external provider.
   - These chunks are relayed immediately to the client using Flask's `Response` with `stream_with_context`.
   - This approach ensures low latency and a more natural conversational experience.

## Why Streaming Support Was Implemented

Streaming support was added to mimic the behavior of native AI chat interfaces, which deliver tokens as they are generated rather than waiting for the complete response. This improves user experience by reducing perceived latency and enabling real-time interaction, essential for conversational AI applications like Copilot.

## Usage

- Ensure the `.env` file contains your API key.
- Run the server:
  ```bash
  python bigtest.py
  ```
  Connect your client (e.g., Ollama or Copilot) to the server's endpoints for chat or model info.
Notes
The server includes rate limiting and cooldown logic to prevent exceeding API quotas.
Error handling ensures graceful fallback during failures.
Extendable for additional endpoints or custom logic as needed.
Disclaimer: This setup is intended for development and testing purposes. For production deployment, consider adding security, logging, and scalability enhancements. ``````
